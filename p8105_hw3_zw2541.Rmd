```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)
```

## Problem 1

#### Read and clean the data
```{r}
library(p8105.datasets)

data("brfss_smart2010")

brfss = brfss_smart2010 %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  rename(state = locationabbr, county = locationdesc) %>% 
  filter(topic == "Overall Health") %>% 
  filter(response %in% c("Excellent", "Very good","Good", "Fair", "Poor")) %>% 
  mutate(response = factor(response, levels = c("Excellent", "Very good","Good", "Fair", "Poor")))
```

#### Using this dataset, do or answer the following:

(1) In 2002, which states were observed at 7 locations?
```{r}
brfss %>% 
  filter(year == "2002") %>% 
  group_by(state) %>% 
  summarize(n_location = n_distinct(county)) %>% 
  filter(n_location == "7")
```

In 2002, Connecticut, Florida, and North Carolina were observed at 7 locations.
